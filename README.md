# HKUST BDT Assignments and Projects

Assignments and Projects I did in HKUST (whatever I could find in my laptop). I spend a lot of time on my assignments and projects, in order to deliver the highest quality. If you are a BDT student in HKUST, this repo could be helpful for you.

## 5001: Data Science Basics

1. [My assignment code](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/tree/master/5001-code)
2. [My solution to the exam](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5001-exam.pdf)
3. [My course project](https://github.com/pranav-ust/transfer)


## 5002: Data Mining

The best organized class of this course. I am extremely thankful to Professor Chen for providing excellent lectures, notes and demanding assignments and exams.

1. [Assignment 1](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5002-A1.pdf)
2. [Assignment 2](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5002-A2.pdf)
3. [Assignment 3](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/tree/master/5002-code)

## 5004: Maths

1. [Assignment 1](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5004-HW1.pdf)
2. [Assignment 2](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5004-HW2.pdf)

## 5007: Optimization

Definitely my favorite subject in this entire course. This class definitely helped me to understand many papers in my area.

1. [Assignment 1](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5007-HW1.pdf)
2. [Assignment 2](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5007-HW2.pdf)
3. [Assignment 3](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5007-HW3.pdf)
4. [Assignment 4](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5007-HW4.pdf)
5. [Assignment 5](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5007-HW5.pdf)

## 5008: Social Computing

1. [Assignment 1](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5008-A1.pdf)
2. [Assignment 2](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/blob/master/5008-A2.pdf)

## 6000B: Deep Learning

1. [Project 1: Regression in Pytorch](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/tree/master/6000B-prediction), topped the leaderboard
2. [Project 2: Transfer Learning](https://github.com/pranav-ust/hkust-materials/tree/master/6000B-flower-Image-Classifier), topped the leaderboard
3. [Project 3: ADMM](https://github.com/pranav-ust/admm), came up with more novel ideas to optimize long tensors.
